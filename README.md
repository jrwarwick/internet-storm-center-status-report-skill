Reports the current global SANS Internet Storm Center thread condition.

## About
The SANS Internet Storm Center (https://isc.sans.edu/about.html) is a free service for general internet community benefit. One of their services is a realtime aggregate global threat level status declaration which may be of interest to IT and security professionals.

TODO: 
 - have Mycroft *automatically* poll this status and proactively alert the user on a change in status.
 - because its a "status" report (slightly more general than the ISC threat condition):
   - scrape diaries for event/alert types of information
   - offer to stream podcasts https://isc.sans.edu/dailypodcast.xml
   - maybe have another intent to display https://isctv.sans.edu/  (first see if it displays nicely on self.gui!)
